# Towers of Hanoi — INF101 Project

Python implementation of the Towers of Hanoi game developed for the INF101 course.

## Project Overview

This project recreates the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle.
The objective is to move all disks from the starting tower to the destination tower while respecting the following rules:

* Only one disk can be moved at a time
* A larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller one

The minimum number of moves required to solve the puzzle with `n` disks is `2^n - 1`.

## Features

* Board representation using Python lists
* Move validation
* Victory detection
* Interactive gameplay via keyboard input
* Graphical interface using Turtle
* Move counter
* Undo last move (history tracking)
* Score saving and ranking system
* Automatic recursive solver
* Optional solution animation

## Project Structure

* Game logic (board management and rules)
* Graphical interface (Turtle drawing)
* User interaction handling
* Score management
* Automatic recursive solver

## How to Run

Make sure Python is installed.

Run:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the instructions displayed in the console.

## Educational Objectives

* Practice list manipulation
* Implement rule validation
* Manage program state
* Use recursion
* Build a graphical interface
* Handle user interaction and data storage
